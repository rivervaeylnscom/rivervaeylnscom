Barclays offers invitation-only personal loans. The information on its website is sparse, but it does advertise a no-fee loan that allows borrowers to choose their payment due dates.

While Barclays used to offer loans to all applicants, you must have received an invitation from the lender to apply.

The lender doesn’t specify how to receive this invitation; however, if you have an existing relationship with the bank or are a member, it can’t hurt to call customer service and ask.
