features personal loans commonly used by individuals to refinance high-interest debt, home renovations and other major purchases. You may be eligible for funding between $1,000 and $50,000 with 24- to 84-month repayment periods if your credit score is at least 600. Plus, you’ll be able to choose a payment date suitable for your spending plan.

Although your borrowing costs may be higher if your credit score is on the lower end, the starting APR is 8.49 percent, making the personal loan from Upgrade a viable option if you have a good or excellent credit score. An origination fee of 1.85 to 9.99 percent applies to all personal loans. That said, this fee may not significantly increase your borrowing costs if you choose to take out a small loan. Another perk is the ability to only borrow $1,000, which isn’t available with the other alternatives.
